### Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Purpose of this repository:

The purpose of this repository includes the following:

1. Provide resources and templates for effective requirement analysis.
2. Document best practices for requirement gathering and prioritization.
3. Serve as a guide for software developers, project managers, and stakeholders.

##What is requirement analysis?

A crucial stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is requirement analysis, during which the project team collects, examines, and specifies the needs for the software product that will be created. This procedure guarantees that everyone involved understands exactly what the system should accomplish and how it should do it.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
##The importance of requirement analysis to SCLC( Software development Lifecycle):
1.Clarity and Understanding: It lessens uncertainty by assisting in the comprehension of what the stakeholders anticipate from the program.
Scope definition helps to avoid scope creep by clearly defining the project's parameters. 2.
2.Foundation for Development and Design: gives the system's design and development a strong basis. 3.
3.Accurate estimation of project costs, resources, and time is made easier with the help of cost and time estimation.
4.Quality assurance raises client satisfaction by making sure the finished product satisfies the requirements.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1.Requirement Gathering:The requirement gathering phase is one of the activities in requirement analysis that involves the following procceses;

- Conduction of interviews with potential stakeholders to understand their needs and wants in order to work towards meeting them.
- Distribution of surveys and organization of workshops to gather requirements from a larger audience.
- Observing end users working environment in order to further understand their needs.
- Review of existing documents to get better understanding of key features and functionalities.

  2.Requirement Eliciation:This phase involves sub phases like:
  Brainstorming:Organization of sessions to generate ideas and requirements.
  Holding focus groups with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
  Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and modify their requirements.

  3.Requirement Documentation: The documentation phase has the following activities:
  Creating a documentation that contains a list of all functional and non-functional requirements.
  Creating user stories to describe functionalities from user's perspective.
  Creating diagrams to display the interactions between users and the system.

  4.Requirement Analysis and modelling: This phase consists of:
  Prioritizing requirements based on their impacts and importance to the project.
  Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
  Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

  5.Requirement Validation: This phase consists of:
  Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
  Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
  Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
