### Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

A crucial stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is requirement analysis, during which the project team collects, examines, and specifies the needs for the software product that will be created. This procedure guarantees that everyone involved understands exactly what the system should accomplish and how it should do it.

## Purpose:

1. Provide resources and templates for effective requirement analysis.
2. Document best practices for requirement gathering and prioritization.
3. Serve as a guide for software developers, project managers, and stakeholders.
