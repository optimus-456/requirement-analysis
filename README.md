### Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Purpose of this repository:

The purpose of this repository includes the following:

1. Provide resources and templates for effective requirement analysis.
2. Document best practices for requirement gathering and prioritization.
3. Serve as a guide for software developers, project managers, and stakeholders.

##What is requirement analysis?

A crucial stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is requirement analysis, during which the project team collects, examines, and specifies the needs for the software product that will be created. This procedure guarantees that everyone involved understands exactly what the system should accomplish and how it should do it.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
##The importance of requirement analysis to SCLC( Software development Lifecycle):
1.Clarity and Understanding: It lessens uncertainty by assisting in the comprehension of what the stakeholders anticipate from the program.
Scope definition helps to avoid scope creep by clearly defining the project's parameters. 2.
2.Foundation for Development and Design: gives the system's design and development a strong basis. 3.
3.Accurate estimation of project costs, resources, and time is made easier with the help of cost and time estimation.
4.Quality assurance raises client satisfaction by making sure the finished product satisfies the requirements.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1.Requirement Gathering:The requirement gathering phase is one of the activities in requirement analysis that involves the following procceses;

- Conduction of interviews with potential stakeholders to understand their needs and wants in order to work towards meeting them.
- Distribution of surveys and organization of workshops to gather requirements from a larger audience.
- Observing end users working environment in order to further understand their needs.
- Review of existing documents to get better understanding of key features and functionalities.

  2.Requirement Eliciation:This phase involves sub phases like:
  Brainstorming:Organization of sessions to generate ideas and requirements.
  Holding focus groups with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
  Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and modify their requirements.

  3.Requirement Documentation: The documentation phase has the following activities:
  Creating a documentation that contains a list of all functional and non-functional requirements.
  Creating user stories to describe functionalities from user's perspective.
  Creating diagrams to display the interactions between users and the system.

  4.Requirement Analysis and modelling: This phase consists of:
  Prioritizing requirements based on their impacts and importance to the project.
  Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
  Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

  5.Requirement Validation: This phase consists of:
  Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
  Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
  Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

### Types of Requirements

Functional Requirements:

1.Search Property requirement.
2.Booking property requirement.
3.Payment Service Requirement.
4.Property Listings Requirement.

Non-Functional Requirements.

1.Performance
2.Security
3.Scalability
4.Usability
5.Reliability

### Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams
Objective: Visual representation of interactions between users and the system.

What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
How to create Use Case Diagrams:

Identify actors (e.g., guest, registered user, admin).
Define use cases (e.g., search properties, book property, manage listings).
Draw interactions between actors and use cases.
Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:

Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.

### Acceptance Criteria

What is acceptance Criteria?
Acceptance criteria are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders.

##How to Define Acceptance Criteria:

Be specific and measurable.
Include functional and non-functional aspects.
Example for Booking System: â€œUsers should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.

##Benefits of Acceptance Criteria:

Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
Provide a basis for testing and validation.
Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.

Example: Acceptance Criteria for a Checkout Feature
Feature: Checkout in the Booking Management System.

Acceptance Criteria:

User Authentication:

Users must be logged in to access the checkout page.
If not logged in, users are redirected to the login page.
Payment Method Selection:

Users can select from available payment methods, such as credit card, PayPal, or bank transfer.
The selected payment method is saved securely for the transaction.
Booking Summary Display:

The checkout page displays a summary of the booking, including:
Dates of the booking.
Total cost (with breakdown of taxes and discounts, if applicable).
Selected booking options (e.g., room type or add-ons).
Payment Validation:

The system validates the payment details before proceeding.
Users are shown an error message if payment fails and can retry.
Confirmation Message:

Upon successful payment, users are shown a confirmation message with a unique booking reference number.
Users receive an email with the booking confirmation and payment receipt.
Error Handling:

If an error occurs (e.g., payment gateway timeout), users are informed with a clear error message and given options to retry or contact support.
These criteria ensure the Checkout feature is functional, user-friendly, and meets the expectations of both the business and the users.
