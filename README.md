### Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Purpose of this repository:

The purpose of this repository includes the following:

1. Provide resources and templates for effective requirement analysis.
2. Document best practices for requirement gathering and prioritization.
3. Serve as a guide for software developers, project managers, and stakeholders.

##What is requirement analysis?

A crucial stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is requirement analysis, during which the project team collects, examines, and specifies the needs for the software product that will be created. This procedure guarantees that everyone involved understands exactly what the system should accomplish and how it should do it.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
##The importance of requirement analysis to SCLC( Software development Lifecycle):
1.Clarity and Understanding: It lessens uncertainty by assisting in the comprehension of what the stakeholders anticipate from the program.
Scope definition helps to avoid scope creep by clearly defining the project's parameters. 2.
2.Foundation for Development and Design: gives the system's design and development a strong basis. 3.
3.Accurate estimation of project costs, resources, and time is made easier with the help of cost and time estimation.
4.Quality assurance raises client satisfaction by making sure the finished product satisfies the requirements.
